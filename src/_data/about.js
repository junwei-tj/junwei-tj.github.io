      I have a passion for web development - specifically creating interactive
      websites that maximise the users' experiences. I love to learn new
      technologies whenever possible and am not afraid to apply what I have
      learnt in my school projects and work. Besides web development, I have
      experience developing Android apps as well as writing automated test
      scripts.
